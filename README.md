## Repository Structure

This repository is divided into four main folders, each containing essential components of the research project:

### `Arduino Code`

Contains all Arduino-related code and versions used throughout the project. This includes the implementation of a random number generator based on chaotic circuits and voltage reading scripts.

### `MATLAB Code`

Houses all MATLAB code developed for the project. This includes:

* Image encryption and decryption algorithms
* Performance testing of the encryption methods
* An initial implementation of the random number generator

### `Test Images`

Includes the test images used during the encryption and decryption experiments.

### `Test Signals`

Contains both simulated and real-world signal data collected for use in the encryption and decryption processes.
