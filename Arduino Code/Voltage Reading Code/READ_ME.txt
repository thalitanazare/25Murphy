Contains all the versions of voltage reading code from the arduino
"ReadVoltageTest" reads all the voltages being outputted by the circuit.
Files containing "Range" only reads the voltage once it has ben triggered by the first spike injected into the circuit
File containing "TwoCircuits" was used when trying to run the code to two chaotic circuits at the same time
