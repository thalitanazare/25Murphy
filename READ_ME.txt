This folder divides the project code up into four:

Arduino Code, containing all the arduino code and versions used throughout the project. Including random number generator and voltage reading code.

MATLAB Code, containing all the MATLAB code used, this includes image encryption and decryption, encryption testing and the initial random number generator used.

Test Images, these are the test images that were used in the project.

Test Signals, This contains both the simulated and practical signal data collected that was used for encryption and decryption.
